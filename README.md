# Manage

## 🚀 Project Description
Manage is a lightweight, responsive single-page task planner. It lets you:
- Filter tasks by date (Today, Tomorrow, Week, Month)  
- Choose task categories (Family, Work, Study, Wish)  
- Set urgency levels (Major, Minor)  
- View and interact with dynamic cards  

Built as a showcase of modern frontend tooling and best practices, Manage demonstrates modular SCSS, Handlebars templating, and a Webpack-powered build pipeline.
